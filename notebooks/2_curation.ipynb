    "In the previous tutorials, we have inserted and sorted our data. This tutorial will go through manual curation. First, a few words on the various tools that we will be using and the ways in which they come into play for curation:\n",
    "\n",
    "[kachery-p2p](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/kachery-p2p): This tool allows us to store and share data conveniently by giving a URI (unique resource identifier; in this case, a 40-digits long, hexadecimal SHA-1 hash) to each file and enabling peer-to-peer download. The advantage of this approach is that one can identify a file without having to specify the path, which may be different on different machines. This facilitates sharing. To use `kachery-p2p`, a daemon must be running. In the Frank lab system in which we share a number of compute resources (e.g. the _virgas_), we have created a dedicated user (`kacheryuser`) who runs the daemon on `typhoon`. As long as you're in the `kachery-users` group (you can check this by logging onto one of our compute servers and typing `groups`), you will be able to use this daemon. In the context of curation, `kachery-p2p` is used to create a _feed_, which you can think of as an append-only log. The feed (like other files) is defined by its URI and is stored in the `kachery-storage` directory via `kachery-p2p`.\n",
    "\n",
    "[labbox-ephys](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/labbox-ephys): This is a visualization tool to curate the results of spike sorting. At the end of spike sorting, a feed is created (`curation_feed_uri` attribute in `SpikeSorting` table) and the recording and the associated sorting objects are added to it. The feed is then considered a _workspace_ (this distinction is somewhat superficial; when you see _feed_, think of a log that can hold any information and is kept track of by `kachery-p2p`; when you see _workspace_, think of a feed in the context of spike sorting). You can add multiple recording and sorting objects to a single workspace. `labbox-ephys` then prepares the visualization for curating based on the information in the workspace, and appends messages to it whenever the user takes an action (e.g. giving a label to a unit). \n",
    "\n",
    "The curation can be done on via a web app or on Jupyter Lab. Here we will first explore the Jupyter Lab widget based curation."

Clicking on a recording then takes you to a page that gives you information about the recording as well as the associated sorting objects. If you then click on the sorting, then it will take you to the curation view. Try exploring the many visualization widgets. The most important is the `Units Table` and the Curation menu, which allows you to give labels to the units. The curation labels will persist even if you| suddenly lose connection to the Jupyter Lab session. This is because these are appended to the workspace as soon as the action is created."
